# PHP-Offline-Geocoder
A KD-Tree based offline geocoder

This library lets you obtain the nearest point in a set, given a target point. This is useful for offline geocoding, without using a geospatial-aware database or similar. There is an example in the `examples/` directory which demonstrates its use.

Inspired by the [Python offline geocoder](https://github.com/thampiman/reverse-geocoder/) by [@thampiman](https://github.com/thampiman/).
